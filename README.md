This is a Django project on Machine learning to predict Diabetics thus naming it as Diabetes Prediction System 
In this project we use data set for calculating if patient are diabetic or not. 
     This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive 
and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict 
whether a patient has diabetes based on certain diagnostic measurements 
included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of 
these instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are 
females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.
